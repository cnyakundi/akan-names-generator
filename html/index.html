      Hello Stranger, this web application is tailored to fetch your birthday

      naming system for people from countries such as Togo, Ivory Coast and
      Ghana. A child’s name is determined by factors surrounding his or her
      birth. These Akan names signify the day one is born. According to Akan
      tradition, each child is born with a name associated with their soul. The
      day the child is born is therefore determined by the soul. As a matter of
      fact, it is possible to tell what led to someone’s birth, the day they
      were born and their rank among the siblings just by their names. Fill the
      short form hereunder by keying in your birthday and gender and generate
      your Akan name.
